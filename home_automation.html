                                    <p>In the modern world, smart home automation systems have become increasingly popular, enabling
                                        convenience, energy efficiency, and enhanced control over home appliances. This project demonstrates a
                                        voice- and gesture-controlled home automation system utilizing an Arduino UNO, HC-05 Bluetooth
                                        module, Python, OpenCV, and MIT App Inventor. The system allows users to control home appliances
                                        such as fans and lights through voice commands and hand gestures, bridging communication between
                                        smartphone applications and microcontrollers. The success of the project will be evaluated based on the
                                        accuracy and reliability of the voice and gesture recognition systems, as well as the overall user
                                        experience, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use for the end user. </p>

                                        cater to diverse user groups, including children and individuals with special needs. By incorporating voicecommand functionality through a user-friendly smartphone application and gesture-based control utilizing
                                        OpenCV for hand gesture recognition, the system provides an inclusive and seamless way to manage
                                        home appliances. Additionally, the integration of serial communication between OpenCV and the Arduino

                                            The app connects to the HC-05 module via Bluetooth. Commands from the app are transmitted to the Arduino via serial  
                                            communication via the Arduino cable.

                                        <li>The app takes in user input as speech and converts it to text, where it matches the keyword in the backend, and sends a

                                        <li><strong>OpenCV for Gesture Recognition:</strong>  
                                            Using Python and OpenCV, we developed a system to recognize specific hand gestures by  
                                            counting the number of fingers visible in the camera’s frame.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Command Transmission:</strong>  
                                            Based on the recognized gesture, Python sends a unique signal to the Arduino, triggering the corresponding  
                                            functionality and running the application.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Integration with Arduino:</strong>  
                                            The same embedded C code on the Arduino processes both Bluetooth commands and commands from the Python program. It  
                                            activates the appliances based on the received signals.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The Python OpenCV program opens the camera on the laptop and assigns each finger to a value in an array as either 1  
                                            (raised) or 0 (down).
                                        </li>
                                        <li>It counts the number of fingers raised and accordingly sends a character value serially to the Arduino Uno via its  
                                            COMM (communication) ports.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The Arduino runs a switch case and executes the functionality respective to the input given by the Python program.</li>
                                        <li>Additionally, connections with an L293D motor driver are given for controlling the speeds of DC motors attached to  
                                            fans and other appliances.
